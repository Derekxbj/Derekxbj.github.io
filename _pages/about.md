*2019.03 - now*: &nbsp; **<font color='red'> As a core member, </font>** I participated in the project of [CAREER: Social Intelligence with Contextual Ambidexterity for Long-Term Human-Robot Interaction and Intervention (LT-HRI2)](http://www.chunghyukpark.com/robots-for-autistic-adolescents.html). 

- The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental principles of human interactions and behaviors and translate these mechanisms into computational modeling and algorithms for a novel assistive robotic framework. Toward this goal, we developed a socially assistive robotic framework with contextual ambidexterity that is perceptive of personal socio-emotional states, capable of learning social skills, emotionally interactive, and gender-smart for long-term human-robot interaction and intervention. Several publications related to this project:
